            <h3><a href="#">August 23rd, 2011 - New Features! Worker Requests!</a></h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Work Orders can now capture worker requests</h4>
                The work order screen has two new buttons. Add (Requests) and Remove (Requests). The add button opens 
                a dialog to search for a worker. Double click on the worker to add him or her as a requested worker. 
                To remove, highlight the worker and hit the remove button next to the list.
                You must still save changes to the record to save the worker request.
                <h4>Work Order Details and Summary performance improvements</h4>
                Two screens important to the dispatchers have been re-designed for faster response. 
                Additionally, the WorkOrders->Summary tab will now take you two the work orders for a given day.
                Double click on a summary row and see!
                <h4>Work Assignments allow editing of the worker assigned (dispatchers only)</h4>
                A new accordion menu is available to dispatchers to edit the worker assigned to a work assignment.

            <div>
                <h4>Duplicate paper copies causing errors</h4>
                Volunteers, please take a moment and read the notices posted regarding printing, or talk with a dispatcher.<br />
                <h4>WorkOrder Details Tab</h4>

                To see a the current day's orders, click "All" and put the date in the search box.<br />

                New and existing work orders now have an alternate ID. The id can be changed to match a paper ID.<br />
                Re-using an ID does not cause an error, but it will in the future.<br />
